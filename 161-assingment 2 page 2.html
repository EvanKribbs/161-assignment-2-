<p> The Aventador powertrain features a mid-mounted naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V-12 that develops 769 horsepower. The engine's 531 pound-feet of torque makes its way to all four wheels via a seven-speed automated-manual transmission. In typical Lamborghini fashion, every Aventador supports a set of scissor doors that swing open. The low-slung interior is showing its age, but it can be fitted with a variety of premium materials and personalized options. The cabin won't hold many small items, and luggage space is limited. The dashboard features a digital gauge cluster that changes its layout whenever you select a new drive modeâ€”Strada, Sport, and Corsa; Ego mode allows you to personalize the settings for powertrain, steering, and suspension. </p>
